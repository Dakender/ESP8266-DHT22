# ESP8266-DHT22
My working copy of a miner and dht22 working together.

* I am by no means an expert at all this.
* This file is a hack/cut/paste of about 20 other vids/docs/word of mouth/etc.
* I finally got it working so that is all that really mattered to me.
* I'm sure there are a bunch of lines that could be removed to clean it up, but wasn't willing to take the chance once it was working.

* Here is the hardware I used.
* All from Amazon.
* If you are trying to use something else, please don't ask for help because I probably don't know.
